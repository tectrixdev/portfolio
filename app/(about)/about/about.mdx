Hi, I'm **Joran Hennion**. I'm **<Age />** years old and a passionate web developer that likes to think out of the box. I'm also a linux passionate, huge fan of fedora at the moment. Photography is also kinda my thing. Really anything you'd throw at me. Like hardware repairs for example. I'm in for all kinds of stuff. <br />
My current intrest are:
- design
- linux (server managment)
